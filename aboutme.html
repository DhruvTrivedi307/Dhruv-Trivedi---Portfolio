            <p class="cd">In 2022, I decided to pivot my focus towards software development, driven by a desire to build solutions from the ground up. I’ve since immersed myself in coding, mastering languages like Java, JavaScript, C, Bash, HTML, and CSS. Each project I work on is a new opportunity to blend my creative background with my technical skills, striving to craft experiences that are as intuitive as they are innovative.</p>
